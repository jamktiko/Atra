Creating a branch:
git branch <branch-name-here>
git checkout <branch-name-here>

In development branch:
git add .
git commit -m '<message>'
git push -u origin <branch-name-here>

When merging to main:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge <branch-name-here>
git push origin main

This triggers Github actions:
deploy hosting-folder into atra-front S3-bucket
trigger cdk (check with diff, if resources/configs have changed) -> creates/updates resources
build app and upload it into atra-front S3-bucket
